      "The Earth's oblateness is caused by its rotation, which creates a centrifugal force that pushes the planet's mass away from the axis of rotation, resulting in a slightly flattened shape at the poles.\n",

      "* **Mountains and valleys**: the Earth's surface has many mountains, valleys, and other features that deviate from a perfect sphere.\n",
      "* **Oceanic and continental crust**: the Earth's crust is composed of different types of rocks and sediments, which can affect the planet's shape.\n",
